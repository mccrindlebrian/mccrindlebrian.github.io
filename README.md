# about me
Hey, I'm Brian! I specialize in computer vision, physics-informed machine learning, and optical systems. I come from a different background than most when it comes to computer science, but I think it adds a nice "spice" to a traditional ML team. :) 

Before getting into machine learning, I studied engineering physics at McMaster University where I focused on lasers, electro-optics, and "old school" computer vision.
