# about me
Hey, I'm Brian! I specialize in computer vision, physics-informed machine learning, and optical systems. I come from a different background than most when it comes to computer science, but I think it adds a nice "spice" to a traditional ML team. :) 

Before getting into machine learning, I studied [engineering physics at McMaster University](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/engphys/) where I focused on lasers, electro-optics, and "old school" computer vision. My Master's of Engineering was in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering focused on improving uncertainty quantification for medical computer vision systems under [Dr. Michael Noseworthy](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/faculty/michael-noseworthy/).
